Linear Algebra Done More Right

My final project is a formalization of part of the first chapter of "Linear Algebra Done Right" by Sheldon Axler. 
The chapter starts with defining and proving properties about Complex numbers, then moves to defining sets of equal-length lists (Fn) 
and proving things about these, and then uses these together to motivate the definition of vector spaces, 
which the book uses as the foundation of teaching Linear Algebra (rather than matrices, as many courses do, such as Math 520 at Brown). 
This is the same progression which I followed in my project, defining things as defined in the textbook and completing its proofs, 
along with a couple additional proofs, helpers, and side notes. I explain each step inside the project file, but this is the general overview. 
During this project, I got to experience planning out proofs and definitions myself, translating from mathematical wording into Lean syntax, 
as well determining the most suitable tools & structures from class this semester to model what the textbook is interested in.
